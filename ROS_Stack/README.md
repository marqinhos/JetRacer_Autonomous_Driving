## Description

Use next packages for own project, using the base name "jetracer_speedway":
- jetracer_speedway
- jetracer_speedway_bringup
- jetracer_speedway_msg
- jetracer_speedway_sensors
- jetracer_speedway_driver
- jetracer_speedway_control
- jetracer_speedway_navigate

Download package in your main computer. Go to jetracer_speedway_bringup/scripts and create a .envrc file, next writte the following information:
- export JETSON_IP=main_pc_ip
- export JETSON_PASSWORD=password_jetson
- export JETSON_USER=name_user_jetson
- export USER_IP=jetson_ip


## Software

#### To run all project:
Go to scripts folder into jetracer_speedway_bringup package. Them run script.sh.
  ``` bash
  ./script.sh
  ```

#### To run only a ros package:
Go to launchs folder into jetracer_speedway_bringup package. Them create a new .launch file, as sample:
``` html
<!-- version: 1.0.0 -->
